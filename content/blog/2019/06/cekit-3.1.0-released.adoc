After link:/blog/2019/04/cekit-3.0.0-released/[3.0.0 release] we decided make our release cycle faster.
We're not afraid of new version numbers, you shouldn't be too üòè

From now on you can expect new minor releases come
out faster. These will be less feature-packed but on other hand this will let us shorten
the time between a bug/feature report and the release containing the fix.

Above introduction would be meaningless without a release, so here it is!

== 3.1.0 is out!

CEKit 3.1.0 was just released!

It contains a few bug fixes for issues reported by users as well as some internal changes
to the tool that should make it more stable and smarter.

You can read the link:https://github.com/cekit/cekit/releases/tag/3.1.0[full changelog on GitHub].

Besides this, we added support for supplementary dist-git items which is discussed below.

== Supplementary dist-git files

Some teams requested the ability to make it possible to maintain upstream set of files that
should be then synced with dist-git repository. There were some iteration on the proposed
design, but we finalized on following one.

If an `osbs_extra` directory will be found next to the image descriptor, then the *contents*
of that directory will be copied into the root of the dist-git repository.

The directory name where to look for files can be controlled in the image descriptor in the
`osbs` section:

{{< highlight yaml >}}
osbs:
    extra_dir: custom-files
{{< /highlight >}}

You can find link:http://docs.cekit.io/en/latest/descriptor/image.html#osbs-extra-directory[this information in documentation too].

‚ö†Ô∏è Please be aware that files in dist-git will be overridden by the files from the supplementary files directory.
